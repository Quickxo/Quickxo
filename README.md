# FrontMVC
> By Gilles Dumoulin

FrontMVC is **not** a MVC framework but a compact [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) **implementation** of the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

MVC frameworks  are really great. However, due to the complexity of their APIs, 
there is additional time learning to use them.

FrontMVC provides a quick starting point for a MVC compliant website without the 
complexity of a complete MVC framework.

- FrontMVC can be used immediately because it is a simple implementation. There is no
framework-specific constraint to learn and to comply with. Just code with it !

- FrontMVC is really simple to figure out, its footprint is minimum (30 kb) and 
therefore allows it to be very fast.

- FrontMVC is robust. It also implements [Front Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller) and 
[Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) design patterns. 
It is supposed to be used in production and can be easily unit tested.

- If needed, as it is an MVC implementation, the website can be quickly ported to a MVC framework afterwards.

You can check out the code, put it at the root server directory and the website is up and running.
You can also refer to the [few Wiki pages](https://github.com/FrontMVC/FrontMVC/wiki) to get started, it is straightforward.
